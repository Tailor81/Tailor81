### 🚀 About Me

I’m not just a coder I’m a builder with a bias for action.  
Rooted in Botswana and driven by the challenges around me, I create practical scalable systems where they matter most. My journey isn’t about chasing prestige or perfect grades (although I do miss being a top achiever); it's about shipping real solutions, learning on the fly, and proving what’s possible with grit, code, and vision.

- **Current Focus:**  
  Building financial technology platforms that actually work—like Campus Cred, a live loan management system trusted by students and delivering a 90% repayment rate.

- **Mindset:**  
  I don’t wait for permission or perfect conditions. I launch, I iterate, I learn. I’m skeptical of authority, allergic to dependency, and loyal to my vision—even as it keeps evolving.

- **Core Values:**  
  Independence over comfort. Learning over praise. Impact over theory.

### ⚡ At My Core

I’m a resilient creative operator—restless, self-directed, and determined to shift systems, not just work inside them. I’m not here to fit in a box. I’m here to build what’s missing, to learn openly, and to challenge the status quo—one project at a time.
